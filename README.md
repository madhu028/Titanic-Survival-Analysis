# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to understand which factors influenced survival and to build models that predict whether a passenger survived.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about passengers such as:

- Passenger class (`Pclass`)
- Sex (`Sex`)
- Age (`Age`)
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (`SibSp`)
- Number of parents/children aboard (`Parch`)
- Fare paid (`Fare`)
- Port of embarkation (`Embarked`)

## Analysis

- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and feature scaling.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib to visualize relationships between features and survival.
- Summary statistics and distributions to identify trends.

## Modeling

- Implementation of classification algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install required packages (see `requirements.txt`).  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to reproduce analysis and model training.
